# Player

You can embed your videos into your website using the Revideo react player.

## Setup

Install the `@revideo/player-react` package into your project:

```bash
npm install @revideo/player-react
```

## Usage

You have two options to use the player:

### 1. Through the CLI (recommended)

Inside your Revideo project directory, run:

```bash
npx revideo serve
```

This will start a local server that builds (and rebuilds) your project and
serves all required assets. You can then embed the player into your website like
this:

```tsx
import {Player} from '@revideo/player-react';

<Player src="http://localhost:4000/player" />;
```

### 2. Manually

If you don't want to use the CLI to serve your built project, you can build it
manually by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an `out` directory in your project root. You can then copy all
of these files to any public directory on your server and embed the player by
specifying the path to the directory. Say you copied the files to
`/public/outDir`, and the folder is accessible via `https://example.com/outDir`,
you can embed the player like this:

```tsx
import {Player} from '@revideo/player-react';

<Player src="https://example.com/outDir" />;
```
