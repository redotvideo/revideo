# HLS Video

Revideo supports the use of HLS video streaming, both for preview in the player
and during rendering. Just note that you cannot use the fast webcodecs based
video decoder for HLS video, and therefore, rendering will be slower than when
using .mp4 files.

To use HLS video, simply set `src` to a file with an `.m3u8` ending in a
`<Video/>` tag.

```tsx editor
import {Video, makeScene2D} from '@revideo/2d';
import {waitFor} from '@revideo/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  yield view.add(
    <>
      <Video
        src={'https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8'}
        play={true}
        height={'100%'}
        time={5}
      />
    </>,
  );

  yield* waitFor(10);
});
```
