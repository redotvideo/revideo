# FFmpeg Issues

Ffmpeg is a powerful tool for video editing. Revideo uses FFmpeg for multiple
tasks, such as concatenating frames into a video, and audio manipulation among
other things.

Revideo uses FFmpeg v6. To make installation easier, we ship a small version of
FFmpeg with Revideo. It is automatically downloaded into the `node_modules`
folder. This means that you do not need to install FFmpeg globally on your
machine.

Below, we list some common issues with ffmpeg and how to fix them.

### SIGSEGV (Segmentation Fault) when running Ffmpeg.

If you're on Linux, the ffmpeg version used in Revideo might cause a segmentation fault if you use remote urls for media files instead of local files.

You can normally fix this issue by installing nscd:

```
sudo apt-get install nscd
```

### Using a custom ffmpeg path

If you want to use a custom version of FFmpeg, you can either set the
environment variable `FFMPEG_PATH` to the path of your FFmpeg binary, or you can
set the path to ffmpeg in the render function. Here is an example:

```tsx
import {renderVideo} from '@revideo/renderer';

// ...

await renderVideo('./vite.config.ts', undefined, undefined, {
  ffmpeg: {
    // Points to the global ffmpeg installation,
    ffmpegPath: 'ffmpeg',
  },
});
```

See the [renderVideo](/renderer/renderVideo) API documentation for more
information.
