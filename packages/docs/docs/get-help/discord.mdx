## How to ask questions

We can best help you with your questions if you give us as much information as
possible. When you run into an issue with Revideo and want to ask a question,
please do the following:

### Investigate yourself

- Can you isolate which piece of your code causes the issue? Try deleting the
  most recent lines of code that caused the issue
- If you are having problems when using a video / audio file: Try changing the
  file to see if the error disappears
- If you are deploying Revideo in the cloud and are facing an issue: check if
  everything works locally on your laptop

### Provide Context

When asking a question, please provide the following information in your
question:

- Which version of Revideo are you running? You can find this in your
  `package.json`
- Have you found anything noteworthy while investigating the issue yourself (see
  above on what to investigate)?
- Are you using a Revideo template? If so, which one? What have you modified?
- Please describe what triggers the issue. Does it occur when you render a
  video, when you start the editor, or when you click a certain button?
- Please provide the full error logs
- If possible, please share (relevant parts of) your code with us.

We understand that this might take some extra effort, but we promise that this
will help us get to a solution for your issue faster!

When messaging us on the Discord channel, please include these bullet points in
your message. Thank you!
