# Deploying a Rendering Service in Production

Rendering videos is a relatively expensive operation compared to most other
requests served in a web app - you should therefore pay attention to which
hardware and deployment setup you want to use to deploy a rendering service for
your Revideo apps.

You should expect a rendering job (a function call to `renderVideo()` or
`renderPartialVideo()` ([API Reference](/api/renderer/renderVideo))) to
**require at least 8-10GB of RAM** to run fast and without issues. When multiple
rendering jobs run at the same time, they will get slower if more RAM is not
available.

Below, we discuss a few possibilities of how you can deploy a rendering service
in production:

## Parallelized Rendering with Serverless Functions (Recommended)

To speed up rendering in production, it's useful to parallelize rendering with
serverless functions using `renderPartialVideo()`
([docs](https://docs.re.video/renderer/renderPartialVideo)). When rendering a 10
minute video, parallelizing across 10 workers would spin up 10 serverless
functions that each render one minute of the video. We have created example
guides for parallelized rendering on AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions.

**Note: In our experiments, parallelized Rendering on AWS Lambda performs
significantly faster due to much better cold start times. We highly recommend
using AWS Lambda for rendering instead of Google Cloud Functions**

### Parallelized Rendering on AWS Lambda

You can find the example project for parallelized rendering on AWS Lambda along
with a setup guide
[here](https://github.com/redotvideo/examples/tree/main/parallelized-aws-lambda)

### Parallelized Rendering with Google Cloud Functions

## Single-process Rendering

If your videos are short and / or rendering speeds are not a huge factor for
you, you can render videos across a single process instead of setting up
parallelized rendering. For example, here is a super simple express server for
rendering a video:

```ts
import {renderVideo} from '@revideo/renderer';
import {v4 as uuidv4} from 'uuid';
import * as express from 'express';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send(`Hello World!`);
});

app.post('/render', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const {variables} = req.body;
    const jobId = uuidv4();

    console.log('Rendering video...');
    await renderVideo({
      projectFile: './src/project.ts',
      variables,
      settings: {outFile: `${jobId}.mp4`, logProgress: true},
    });
    console.log('Finished rendering');

    const outputFilePath = path.join(process.cwd(), `./output/${jobId}.mp4`);

    if (fs.existsSync(outputFilePath)) {
      res.sendFile(outputFilePath); // alternatively (and recommended), upload file to a bucket
    } else {
      res.status(500).send('Rendered video not found');
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error rendering video:', err);
    res.status(500).send('Error rendering video');
  }
});

const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT) || 8000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

You can deploy a server like this on a normal VM instance or on a serverless
deployment platform like Google Cloud Run.

## Revideo platform

We are building a cloud platform that makes it easy to deploy Revideo projects
and uses infrastructure optimized for fast rendering speeds. You can sign up to
its waitlist [here](https://tally.so/r/mOz4GK).
