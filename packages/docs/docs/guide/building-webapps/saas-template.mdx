# Revideo SaaS Template

The Revideo SaaS Template is a minimal NextJS app that lets users preview and
make changes to a video, and also lets them export their video to mp4.

This project is the best starting point if you want to build a web app with
Revideo. You can find its code in the corresponding
[Github repository](https://github.com/redotvideo/examples/tree/main/saas-template)
or select it as a template when running `npm init @revideo@latest`.
