# Designing Animations

Revideo's API for designing animations is the same as the API of Motion Canvas.
If you want to learn how to build animations, you should read through the
[Motion Canvas Guide](/category/motion-canvas-guide).

If you like to learn from examples, you can check out our
[Code Snippets](/category/code-snippets), where you can find code examples of
common animations, such as [streaming text](/streaming-text) or
[moving objects](/moving-manipulating-objects)
