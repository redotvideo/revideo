# Blurring

You can blur elements of your video using either the blur
[filter implementation](https://docs.re.video/filters-and-effects#filters) or
the `backgroundBlur` property of any `Shape` node (such as `<Circle/>` or
`<Rect/>`).

In most cases, you should use the filter implementation as it is much more
performant than the `backgroundBlur` implementation - particularly when the area
you want to blur is large, using the background blur property will cause much
slower rendering speeds. However, there are a few cases where you might run into
limitations of the filter implementation:

- You want to avoid transparent edges, which occur when using the filter
  implementation.
- You want to blur only a specific part of the canvas, such as specific
  coordinates of an `<Img/>` node, instead of the full `<Img/>` node.

Below, you can find examples of both implementations.

## Filter Blur

You can use the blur filter to blur a full element, such as an `<Img/>` node:

```tsx editor
import {makeScene2D, Img} from '@revideo/2d';
import {createRef, waitFor} from '@revideo/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const img = createRef<Img>();

  yield view.add(
    <Img
      src={'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/sf.png'}
      height={'100%'}
      ref={img}
    />,
  );

  yield* waitFor(1);
  yield* img().filters.blur(20, 1);
  yield* waitFor(2);
});
```

You might notice that the edges of the image become transparent, which is in
some cases undesirable - also, it is impossible to blur only parts of the image,
as the filter is applied to the full `<Img/>` node.

## Background Blur

As an alternative to filter blurs, you can also use the `backgroundBlur`
property for any node that is an instance of
[`<Shape/>`](/api/2d/components/Shape/). This will blur anything behind the node
you apply it to, and therefore allows you to blur only parts of images or videos
instead of the full node. Background blurs also don't cause transparent edges:

```tsx editor
import {makeScene2D, Img, Rect} from '@revideo/2d';
import {createRef, waitFor} from '@revideo/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const img = createRef<Img>();
  const blurRect = createRef<Rect>();

  yield view.add(
    <>
      <Img
        src={'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/sf.png'}
        height={'100%'}
        ref={img}
      />
      <Rect
        opacity={0}
        backgroundBlur={20}
        size={img().size()}
        ref={blurRect}
      />
    </>,
  );

  yield* waitFor(1);
  yield* blurRect().scale(0.4, 1);
  yield* blurRect().position.x(50, 1);
  yield* waitFor(2);
});
```
