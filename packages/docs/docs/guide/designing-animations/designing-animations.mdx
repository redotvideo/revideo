# Motion Canvas

Revideo was forked from [Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/) - therefore, both projects largely share the same API for designing animations.
If you want to learn how to build animations, you should read through the
[Motion Canvas Guide](/category/motion-canvas-guide). API changes that are specific to Revideo (such as the addition of [Rive animations](/rive-animations)) or relevant for Revideo's use cases, are listed in the following pages.

If you like to learn from examples, you can check out our
[Code Snippets](/category/code-snippets), where you can find code examples of
common animations, such as [streaming text](/streaming-text) or
[moving objects](/moving-manipulating-objects).
