# Logical Separation of Scene Components

A question that frequently comes up from Revideo users is how to organize your
scene code to achieve good logical separation and make things readable.

## Custom Generator Functions

Revideo lets you define your scene code as a generator function wrapped in
`makeScene2D`. Here is a mininal example that displays an image for five
seconds:

```tsx
import {Img, makeScene2D, View2D} from '@revideo/2d';
import {waitFor} from '@revideo/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  yield view.add(
    <Img
      width={'30%'}
      ref={logoRef}
      src={
        'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/revideo-logo-white.png'
      }
    />,
  );

  yield* waitFor(5);
});
```

Let's say that you additionally want to display some text:

```tsx
import {Img, Txt, makeScene2D} from '@revideo/2d';
import {waitFor} from '@revideo/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  yield view.add(
    <Img
      width={'30%'}
      ref={logoRef}
      src={
        'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/revideo-logo-white.png'
      }
    />,
  );

  yield view.add(<Txt fill="red" y={300} text={'Hello World!'} />);

  yield* waitFor(5);
});
```

Instead of adding the text node inside your main function, you can also create a
separate generator function that does so and is called within your main
generator function:

```tsx
import {Img, Txt, makeScene2D} from '@revideo/2d';
import {waitFor} from '@revideo/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  yield view.add(
    <Img
      width={'30%'}
      ref={logoRef}
      src={
        'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/revideo-logo-white.png'
      }
    />,
  );

  yield addText(view, 'Hello World!');

  yield* waitFor(5);
});

function* addText(view: View2D, displayText: string) {
  yield view.add(<Txt fill="red" y={300} text={displayText} />);

  yield* waitFor(5);
}
```

Especially as your scenes get more complex, it makes sense to separate different
parts of them (for example, you might have your main video definition in one
function and subtitling logic in another one).

### Calling generator functions with `yield` and `yield*`:

When you have multiple generator functions that you want to use, it is important
to mention the difference between `yield` and `yield*`:

`yield` will call your generator function but not wait for it to finish
executing before executing the rest of your code. If you have a generator
function `displaySubtitles()`, this will make a big difference:

Say you have the following code:

```tsx
yield displaySubtitles();
// rest of your scene code, will get displayed at the same time as subtitles
```

This will display your subtitles along the rest of your scene code - it will not
wait for all subtitles to have finished.

On the other hand, if you use `yield*`, the main generator function will wait
for `displaySubtitles()` to finish executing before displaying your remaining
animations:

```tsx
yield * displaySubtitles(); // wait for displaySubtitles to finish
// rest of your scene code, will get displayed after subtitles
```

If you have two generator functions that you want to display at the same time,
you can therefore call both subsequently with `yield`:

```tsx
yield displaySubtitles();
yield displayImages();
```

Alternatively, you can use the `all` function:

```tsx
yield * all(displaySubtitles(), displayImages());
```

If you want to display functions subsequently, you can call them subsequently
with `yield*` or use `chain`:

```tsx
yield * displaySubtitles();
yield * displayImages();
```

This yields the same result as:

```tsx
yield * chain(displaySubtitles(), displayImages());
```

You can learn more about controlling the animation flow with functions like
`all` and `chain` [here](/flow).

## Custom Components

You can build your own `<CustomComponent/>` to use in your revideo projects. A
good guide for this is available in the
[Motion Canvas guide](/custom-components).

**Note:** In most cases, you won't have to implement a custom `draw()` function
when building a custom component. If you do, note that `draw()` functions in
Revideo need to be implemented as async functions, while they are synchronous in
Motion Canvas.
