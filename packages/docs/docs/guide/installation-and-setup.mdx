# Quickstart

Let's install revideo with a sample project. To use revideo, make sure that you
have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 16 or greater.

:::info

If you're on Linux, also make sure that you have nscd installed:
`sudo apt-get install nscd`. You need this package for
[ffmpeg](/common-issues/ffmpeg).

:::

### Creating a new project

Run the following command to create a new revideo project (If this fails, check
out the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section):

```bash
npm init @revideo@latest
```

Now, select the **default project**, navigate to its folder and install all
dependencies:

```shell
cd <project-path>
npm install
```

To preview your video in the editor, run:

```shell
 npm start
```

The editor can now be accessed by visiting
[http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/). Here you should see the video
shown below.

<video width="708" height="400" controls>
  <source
    src="https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/revideo-example.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

```tsx
import {Audio, Img, Video, makeScene2D} from '@revideo/2d';
import {all, chain, createRef, waitFor} from '@revideo/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const logoRef = createRef<Img>();

  yield view.add(
    <>
      <Video
        src={'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/stars.mp4'}
        play={true}
        size={['100%', '100%']}
      />
      <Audio
        src={'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/chill-beat.mp3'}
        play={true}
        time={17.0}
      />
    </>,
  );

  yield* waitFor(1);

  view.add(
    <Img
      width={'1%'}
      ref={logoRef}
      src={
        'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/revideo-logo-white.png'
      }
    />,
  );

  yield* chain(
    all(logoRef().scale(40, 2), logoRef().rotation(360, 2)),
    logoRef().scale(60, 1),
  );
});
```

## Rendering the Video

You can render your video by running:

```
npm run render
```

This will call the `./src/render.ts` script in your code:

```ts
import {renderVideo} from '@revideo/renderer';

async function render() {
  console.log('Rendering video...');

  // This is the main function that renders the video
  const file = await renderVideo({
    projectFile: './src/project.ts',
    settings: {logProgress: true},
  });

  console.log(`Rendered video to ${file}`);
}

render();
```

For more information, check out the [renderVideo()](/api/renderer/renderVideo)
API reference.

Alternatively, you can also render your video using the button in the editor
that starts when you run `npm run start`.

### Rendering from the browser

To render videos from the editor, simply click the "Render" Button:

![Render Button](https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/render-button.png)

## Understanding the Video Code

For now, we can ignore all files in our revideo project except for
`src/scenes/example.tsx`, as this is where the visuals and audio of our video
are defined. Let's walk through all the parts of the code that might confuse
you, and provide explanations and references.

### Defining a generator function

Our animation is defined within a generator function that is passed to
`makeScene2D` - this function describes the sequence of events happening in our
video:

```tsx
import {Audio, Img, Video, makeScene2D} from '@revideo/2d';
import {all, chain, createRef, waitFor} from '@revideo/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
// your animation flow here
}
```

Generator functions can return multiple values - when they are called, they will
execute until they first encounter a `yield` statement, and return the yielded
value. Revideo renders animations by continually calling the generator function,
which will yield frames that we can export. It is not neccessary to understand
how this works exactly, but if you are interested, you can read about the
animation flow in revideo [here](/flow).

### Adding Video and Audio elements

At the start of our generator function, we add [Video](/api/2d/components/Video)
and [Audio](/api/2d/components/Audio) tags to our `view`, which will display
them on the canvas. Other components you could add include
[Txt](/api/2d/components/Txt) or [Img](/api/2d/components/Img) tags, or basic
shapes like [Rect](api/2d/components/Rect) or
[Circle](api/2d/components/Circle). You can find the API for all components
[here](api/2d/components).

```tsx
yield view.add(
  <>
    <Video
      src={'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/stars.mp4'}
      play={true}
      size={['100%', '100%']}
    />
    <Audio
      src={'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/chill-beat.mp3'}
      play={true}
      time={17.0}
    />
  </>,
);
```

A few points about input arguments:

- In both cases, `src` refers to the file, which points to a remote url on the
  bucket. Alternatively, you can use local files by passing their path.
- Passing `size={["100%", "100%"]}` makes the video stretch to the full width
  and height of its canvas.
- Adding `play={true}` makes both media elements play immediately, instead of
  being in a paused state.

### Play media for one second

After adding our background video and audio, we execute

```tsx
yield * waitFor(1);
```

The function [waitFor](/api/core/flow/#waitFor) does - as the name suggests -
nothing. It is particularly useful when waiting for media (like videos and
audio) to play or when we want to have a still-standing image.

### Animating the revideo logo

Lastly, we let the revideo logo spin into our video:

```tsx
view.add(
  <Img
    width={'1%'}
    ref={logoRef}
    src={
      'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/revideo-logo-white.png'
    }
  />,
);

yield *
  chain(
    all(logoRef().scale(40, 2), logoRef().rotation(360, 2)),
    logoRef().scale(60, 1),
  );
```

A few things happen here: First, we add the revideo logo as an
[Img](/api/2d/components/Img) to our canvas. We set its initial width to only 1%
of the screen, as we want it to grow as the video plays. We also pass a
[reference](/references) through `ref={logoRef}`, which we had initialized
before. Like [React refs](https://react.dev/learn/referencing-values-with-refs),
references allow us to access and modify the behavior of elements after they've
been initialized.

In our code, we use a reference to the revideo logo to later animate it.
Particularly, we run the following commands:

- `scale(x, s)`: scales the size of the logo to `x` times its original size,
  within `n` seconds.
- `rotation(d, s)`: rotates the image by `d` degrees within `s` seconds

The flow of these animations is determined by the keywords [chain](/flow/#chain)
and [all](/flow/#all). The former instructs revideo to play its input animations
after one another, while the latter instructs revideo to play them
simultaneously. As a result, we first see the revideo logo rotating around 360
degrees while growing to 40x its original size. After this is done, the logo
still grows to 60x its original size. You can learn more about the animation
flow in revideo [here](/flow).

<!---

Now save the file. Any changes you make are automatically picked up and
reflected in the preview.

You should see a red circle in the preview pane at the top right of the web
application. Press the play button to see the circle animate across the screen.

### Explanation

Each video in Motion Canvas is represented by a project configuration object. In
our example, this configuration is declared in `src/project.ts`:

```ts title="src/project.ts"
import {makeProject} from '@revideo/core';

import example from './scenes/example';

export default makeProject({
  scenes: [example],
});
```

When creating a project, we need to provide it with an array of scenes to
display. In this case, we use only one scene imported from
`src/scenes/example.tsx`.

A scene is a set of elements displayed on the screen and an animation that
governs them. The most basic scene looks as follows:

```tsx
import {makeScene2D} from '@revideo/2d';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  // animation
});
```

`makeScene2D()` takes a function generator and turns it into a scene which we
then import in our project file. The function generator describes the flow of
the animation, while the provided `view` argument is used to add elements to the
scene.

You can learn more about scenes, nodes, and this XML-like syntax in the
[scene hierarchy](/hierarchy) section. For now, what's important is that,
in our example, we add an individual [`<Circle/>`](/api/2d/components/Circle)
node to our scene. We make it red, set its width and height as `140` pixels and
position it `300` pixels left from the center:

```tsx
view.add(
  <Circle
    // highlight-start
    ref={myCircle}
    x={-300}
    width={140}
    height={140}
    fill="#e13238"
  />,
);
```

To animate our circle we first need to
[grab a reference to it](/references). That's the purpose of the
[`createRef`](/api/core/utils#createRef) function. We use it to create a
reference and pass it to our circle using the
[`ref`](/api/2d/components/NodeProps#ref) attribute:

```tsx
// highlight-next-line
const myCircle = createRef<Circle>();

view.add(
  <Circle
    // highlight-next-line
    ref={myCircle}
    x={-300}
    width={140}
    height={140}
    fill="#e13238"
  />,
);
```

We then access the circle through `myCircle()` and animate its properties:

```tsx
yield *
  all(
    myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1).to('#e13238', 1),
    myCircle().position.x(300, 1).to(-300, 1),
  );
```

This snippet may seem a bit confusing so let's break it down.

Each property of a node can be read and updated throughout the animation. For
example, in the circle above we defined its `fill` property as `'#e13238'`:

```tsx
<Circle
  ref={myCircle}
  x={-300}
  width={140}
  height={140}
  // highlight-next-line
  fill="#e13238"
/>
```

Using our reference we can now retrieve this property's value:

```ts
const fill = myCircle().fill(); // '#e13238'
```

We can also update it by passing the new value as the first argument:

```ts
myCircle().fill('#e6a700');
```

This will immediately update the color of our circle. If we want to transition
to a new value over some time, we can pass the transition duration (in seconds)
as the second argument:

```ts
myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1);
```

This [creates a tween animation](/tweening) that smoothly changes the fill
color over one second.

Animations in Motion Canvas don't play on their own, we need to explicitly tell
them to. This is why scenes are declared using generator functions - they serve
as a description of how the animation should play out. By yielding different
instructions we can tell the scene animation to do different things.

For example, to play the tween we created, we can do:

```ts
yield * myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1);
```

This will pause the generator, play out the animation we yielded, and then
continue.

To play another animation, right after the first one, we can simply write
another `yield*` statement:

```ts
yield * myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1);
yield * myCircle().fill('#e13238', 1);
```

But since we're animating the same property, we can write it in a more compact
way:

```ts
yield * myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1).to('#e13238', 1);
```

In our example, aside from changing the color, we also move our circle around.
We can try doing it the same way we animated the color:

```ts
yield * myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1).to('#e13238', 1);
yield * myCircle().position.x(300, 1).to(-300, 1);
```

This works, but the position will start animating **after** the fill color. To
make them happen at the same time, we use the [`all`][all] function:

```ts
yield *
  all(
    myCircle().fill('#e6a700', 1).to('#e13238', 1),
    myCircle().position.x(300, 1).to(-300, 1),
  );
```

[`all`][all] takes one or more animations and merges them together. Now they'll
happen at the same time. The [animation flow](/flow) section goes into more
depth about generators and flow functions such as [`all`][all].

This brings us back to our initial example:

## Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>
    <code>npm init @revideo@latest</code> fails to execute.
  </summary>

There was [a bug in npm](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/5175) causing the
above command to fail. It got fixed in version `8.15.1`. You can follow
[this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm) to
update your npm. Alternatively, you can use the following command instead:

```bash
npm exec @revideo/create@latest
```

</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    <code>npm install</code> fails with <code>code ENOENT</code>
  </summary>

If `npm install` fails with the following error:

```bash
npm ERR! code ENOENT
npm ERR! syscall open
npm ERR! path [path]\package.json
npm ERR! errno -4058
npm ERR! enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '[path]\package.json'
npm ERR! enoent This is related to npm not being able to find a file.
npm ERR! enoent
```

Make sure that you're executing the command in the correct directory. When you
finish bootstrapping the project with `npm init`, it will display three
commands:

```bash
cd [path]
npm install
npm start
```

Did you run the `cd` command to switch to the directory containing your project?

</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    I moved the camera too far away and can't find the preview (The preview is is black)
  </summary>

You can press `0` to refocus the camera on the preview.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>
    The animation ends abruptly or does not start at the beginning.
  </summary>

Make sure the playback range selector in the timeline starts and ends where you
expect it to, e.g., at the beginning and end of your animation. The range
selector is a gray bar in the time axis of your timeline. When you move your
mouse over it, six dots will appear allowing you to manipulate it.

  <summary>
    File watching does not work on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2
  </summary>

When running Vite on WSL2, file system watching does not work if a file is
edited by Windows applications.

To fix this, move the project folder into the WSL2 file system and use WSL2
applications to edit files. Accessing the Windows file system from WSL2 is slow,
so this will improve performance.

For more information view the
[**Vite Docs**](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-watch).
