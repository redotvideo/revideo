# Project Structure

Revideo projects are structured similar to most Typescript projects. Here is the
structure of the default project that gets initialized when you run
`npm init @revideo@latest`:

```
my-project/
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── vite.config.ts
├── src/
│   ├── project.ts
│   ├── render.ts
│   ├── project.meta
│   └── scenes/
│       └── example.tsx
└── public/
    └── my-video.mp4
```

Let's walk through the most relevant files:

### `./src/scenes/example.tsx`

Files inside the `./src/scenes` folder such as `example.tsx` are the ones you'll
modify the most in order to define video templates. Scenes describe how your
video should look like. They need to specify a default export that calls
`makeScene2D` on a generator function describing what the desired video should
look like:

```tsx
import {Video, makeScene2D} from '@revideo/2d';
import {waitFor} from '@revideo/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const videoFile = useScene().variables.get(
    'video',
    'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/stars.mp4',
  )();

  yield view.add(<Video src={videoFile} size={['100%', '100%']} play={true} />);

  yield* waitFor(10);
});
```

### `./src/project.ts`

Your project file does two things:

1. It defines an array of scenes to create a full video
2. It accepts video variables that will be passed to your video when you look at
   it in the visual editor (when you run `npm start`)

```
import {makeProject} from '@revideo/core';

import example from './scenes/example?scene';
import example2 from './scenes/example2?scene';


export default makeProject({
  scenes: [example, example2],
  variables: { video: "https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/beach.mp4"}
});
```

When specifying multiple scenes, the scenes will be played after another. You
can also add [transitions](/transitions) between them. A new scene will not
inherit any nodes from an old scene. This can have a positive influence on
performance, especially when your scene is very bloated (as it contains a lot of
nodes). In this case, recalculating the scene (for instance when navigating to a
new time in the player) can be an expensive operation and is faster when you
have multiple smaller scenes instead.

However, in most cases, it is not necessary to use multiple scenes. For logical
seperation, you can instead define generator function outside of your main
generator function in `makeScene2D` and call them there.

### `vite.config.ts`

Revideo projects are served using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The
`vite.config.ts` file specifically configures the server used to serve the
visual editor you see when running `npm start` inside your project. The default
config looks as follows:

```ts
import {defineConfig} from 'vite';
import motionCanvas from '@revideo/vite-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [motionCanvas()],
});
```

As you can see, the default settings are sufficient, and the only thing we
modify is using the 'motionCanvas' plugin. This plugin enables Motion Canvas /
Revideo-related functionality, such as communication between the browser in
which the HTML canvas is rendered and drawn to, and a "backend" process running
ffmpeg for audio processing.

You can modify some settings of the motion canvas plugin, for instance to point
to another project file than the default `project.ts`, or to select another
output folder than the default `./output`. You can also modify some vite server
settings here, for instance on which port your application is served:

```ts
import {defineConfig} from 'vite';
import motionCanvas from '@revideo/vite-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    motionCanvas({
      output: './other-output-folder',
      project: './src/project2.ts',
    }),
  ],
  server: {
    port: 5000,
  },
});
```

### `./src/render.ts`

This file contains code to render your video. By default, you can execute its
code by running `npm run render` (assuming that you bootstrapped your project
using `npm init @revideo@latest`). Note that the
[`renderVideo()`](/api/renderer/renderVideo) function accepts variables of its
own and does not use the ones from `./src/project.ts`.

```
import {renderVideo} from '@revideo/renderer';

async function render() {
	console.log('Rendering video...');

	// This is the main function that renders the video
	const file = await renderVideo({
		projectFile: './src/project.ts',
        variables: { video: "" }
		settings: { logProgress: true }
	});

	console.log(`Rendered video to ${file}`);
}

render();
```

This code is not neccessary to start the editor or your project and is not tied
to any other rendering functionality (like the renderer of the development
server from `npx revideo serve`). You can safely remove it if you don't need it.

### Files in `/public`

If you want to work with local files, you can put them into the `/public`
folder. You can then access them inside your scene via their name:

```tsx
import {Video, makeScene2D} from '@revideo/2d';
import {waitFor} from '@revideo/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  yield view.add(
    <Video src={'/my-video.mp4'} size={['100%', '100%']} play={true} />,
  );

  yield* waitFor(10);
});
```
