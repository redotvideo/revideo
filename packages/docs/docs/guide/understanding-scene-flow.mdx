# Scene Flow

Revideo lets you define your scene through a generator function. This section
will go into more detail about how this works and walk through a few examples to
provide a better understanding for developers. It is also **highly recommended**
to read through the [Motion Canvas guide](/category/motion-canvas-guide) for
better understanding.

## Scenes are defined sequentially

Generator functions are defined as a sequence of `yield`s. When you first call a
generator function, the first yielded value gets returned. When you call it
again, the second yielded value gets returned:

```ts
function* example() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const generator = example();

console.log(generator.next().value); // 1;
console.log(generator.next().value); // 2;
console.log(generator.next().value); // 3;
```

The fact that Revideo uses generator functions lets you define your videos in an
intuitive imperative manner - When thinking about what your video should look
like, you'll probably think of it as a sequence of concrete steps:

- At first, a red circle should appear in the center of my video
- The circle should move to the right by 200 pixels within two seconds
- Then, the circle disappears from the video
- Afterwards, nothing happens for one second

In Revideo, your code can be translated in a relatively straightforward way -
you can read your scene code from top to bottom to understand what is happening:

```tsx editor
import {Circle, makeScene2D} from '@revideo/2d';
import {createRef, waitFor} from '@revideo/core';

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const circleRef = createRef<Circle>();

  // At first, a red circle should appear in the center of my video
  yield view.add(<Circle fill={'red'} size={100} ref={circleRef} />);

  // The circle should move to the right by 200 pixels within two seconds
  yield* circleRef().position.x(200, 2);

  // Then, the circle disappears from the video
  circleRef().remove();

  // Afterwards, nothing happens for one second
  yield* waitFor(1);
});
```

In many cases, you might want to do animate multiple things in parallel. For
this, you can use flow generators like [`all`](/flow#all).

## `yield` vs `yield*` vs no yield

Something that confuses many people getting started with Revideo is the
difference between `yield*` and `yield`, as well as the difference between
`yield view.add` and calling `view.add` without yielding.

### `yield view.add` vs `view.add`

When looking at code examples of Revideo, you might notice that they sometimes
contain `yield view.add` and sometimes only `view.add`- this is not limited to
`view`, but also to many other operations or adding to nodes other than `View2D`
nodes.

Adding a `yield` in front of an operation ensures that Revideo awaits any
promises associated with that operation, such as network requests or awaiting
fonts to load. As an example, here is code that has a yield in front of it as it
creates a promise:

```tsx
yield view.add(
  <Img
    src={
      'https://revideo-example-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/revideo-logo-white.png'
    }
  />,
);
```

In the code above, we initialize an `Img` node which loads an image from the
internet. This creates a promise - adding a `yield` in front of `view.add`
ensures that the code will continue executing only once the promise is resolved
(the image is loaded).

Promises are not just caused by obvious network requests such as the one above.
They might also be created if you add a text node, as Revideo will have to wait
for the `document.fonts.ready` event to fire. If you want to be safe, you can
simply `yield` every `add` call - this is a good catch-all and won't cause
problems. If you don't have a `yield` in front of an operation that creates a
promise, Revideo will also throw a warning that says
`Tried to access an asynchronous property before the node was ready`.

### Will calling `yield` add an extra frame to my video?

We often explain Revideo by saying that every `yield` corresponds to a frame in
your video. This is good for a rough understanding, but not 100% correct. A
`yield` will only correspond to a frame when the yielded value is falsy. When
stepping through your generator function to render a video, this is how Revideo
decides if it should draw a frame or not (pseudocode):

```ts
let result = scene.next();

// we don't draw a frame while the yield is not empty
while (result.value) {
  // promises get awaited
  if (isPromise(result.value)) {
    result = await result.value;

    // the yielded value should be a promise; you shouldn't do something like `yield 5;` inside your scene
  } else {
    console.warn('Invalid value yielded by the scene.');
  }

  result = scene.next();
}

// when the result is empty (while loop passed), we render a frame
drawFrame();
```

Looking at some scene code, this is what would happen:

```tsx
yield view.add(<Img src={'img.png'} />); // yielded promise, we await it and dont render a frame.

// we yield 30 empty values, corresponding to 30 frames (or 1 second of video in case of 30fps). This is the same as calling yield* waitFor(1);
for (let i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
  yield;
}
```

### `yield` vs `yield*`

`yield` is used to pause the execution of a generator and return a single value,
whereas `yield*` delegates to another generator function. Roughly speaking, you
should `yield` everything that's just a single operation, while you `yield*`
generators that produce multiple frames:

```tsx
yield view.add(<Img src={'img.png'} />); // doesn't produce a frame

yield * waitFor(1); // takes time, produces multiple frames
```
