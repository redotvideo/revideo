# Welcome to Revideo!

Revideo is an open-source framework for programmatic video editing. It lets you
create video templates in Typescript and provides an API to render these video
templates with dynamic inputs. It also provides a player component that you can
embed into your website to let users preview videos before exporting them to
mp4. Developers use Revideo to automate certain video editing tasks or to build
entire web-based video editors.

Revideo is forked from
[Motion Canvas](https://github.com/motion-canvas/motion-canvas), an editor that
lets you create animations with code. While Motion Canvas happens to be
distributed as an npm package, the maintainers don't intend for it to be used as
a library but as a standalone editing tool.
