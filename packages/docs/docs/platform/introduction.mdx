# Introduction

The Revideo platform makes it easy to deploy Revideo projects in production. It
works as follows:

- You sign up to the Revideo platform using your Github account
- Within the platform, you can select a Github repository that contains a
  Revideo project of yours
- The platform will automatically set up a `/render` endpoint that handles fast
  parallelized rendering
- Every time you push to your Github repository, the platform will set up a new
  endpoint

The Revideo platform is not yet publicly launched, but is used by selected
teams. If you want to get access to deploy a Revideo project of yours, you can
sign up to our [waitlist](https://tally.so/r/mOz4GK) or directly email us at
[justus@re.video](mailto:justus@re.video).
