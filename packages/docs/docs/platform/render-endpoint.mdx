# Using your Render Endpoint

Your deployments are listed at
`https://re.video/platform/{org-name}/{repo-name}`. Here, you can find a list of
deployments corresponding to every commit you made:

## Rendering a Video

To render a video using one of your deployments, you can get its render url by
clicking onto "Copy url". Now, you can send a POST request like this (see
[here](/platform/render-endpoint#arguments) for all request parameters):

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.re.video/v1/render/{your-deployment-id} \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: <your-api-key>' \
  -d '{
    "variables": {
      "text": "Hello world",
      "color": "#FF0000"
    },
    "settings": {
      "workers": 5
    }
  }'
```

## Arguments

### variables

_any_

The parameters of your video

### callbackUrl?

_string, optional_

A callback to send the request response to. This is optional and probably not
neccessary if you don't render very long videos - if not supplied, the request
will remain open during rendering.

### settings

An object with the following parameters

#### workers

_number_

The number of workers you want to parallelize the rendering job across

## Return Value

The return value depends on whether a `callbackUrl` is provided in the request.

### Without callbackUrl

If no `callbackUrl` is provided, the API will respond with a JSON object
containing the render result. The response will have a status code of 200 if
successful.

```json
{
  "resultUrl": "https://<revideo-storage-url>.com/<your-video-id>.mp4"
}
```

### With callbackUrl

If a `callbackUrl` is provided:

1. The API will immediately respond with a status code of 200 and the body "ok".
2. Once the rendering is complete, a POST request will be sent to the provided
   `callbackUrl` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "resultUrl": "https://<revideo-storage-url>.com/<your-video-id>.mp4"
}
```

### Error Responses

The API may return the following error responses:

- 401 Unauthorized: If the provided API key is invalid.
- 400 Bad Request: If the `deploymentId` is invalid, if the request body fails
  validation, or if the deployment is not running.
- 404 Not Found: If the specified deployment doesn't exist.
- 500 Internal Server Error: If there's an error getting the deployment,
  creating the render job, or during the rendering process.

Error responses will contain a plain text message describing the error.
