# Deploy a Revideo Project

You can use our CLI to deploy your revideo project, which will expose a web
server with endpoints for rendering videos and downloading rendered videos as
mp4. An application example of this can be found in our
[Saas template](https://github.com/redotvideo/examples/saas-template).

To deploy a Revideo project, run the following command:

```bash
npx revideo serve --projectFile ./src/project.ts --port 3000
```

The `--port` parameter is optional. By default, the service will use port 4000.

## Starting a render job

Once your Revideo project is deployed, you can render videos using the `/render`
endpoint by passing your desired `settings` and `variables` as a parameter. This
endpoint will trigger a render process on the server, and respond with a
download url once the rendering process has finished.

**Example request:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://your-revideo-service.com/render \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "variables": {
      "image": "some-image.png",
      "color": "red"
    },
    "settings": { "workers": 2 }
  }'
```

If you want to report the rendering progress back to the client, you can set the
`streamProgress` parameter to true:

```bash
curl -X POST http://your-revideo-service.com/render \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "variables": {
      "image": "some-image.png",
      "color": "red"
    },
    "settings": { "workers": 2 },
    "streamProgress": true
  }'
```

## Rendering With Callbacks

If you don't want to keep the connection to the server open during the full
duration of the rendering process, you can render videos with the `callbackUrl`
parameter. This will trigger a render process on the server, and respond to a
callback url after the rendering process is done.

**Example request:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://your-revideo-service.com/render \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "variables": {
      "image": "some-image.png",
      "color": "red"
    },
    "callbackUrl": "http://your-callback-url.com/render-status"
  }'
```

In this request, `variables` refer to the variables passed to your video, and
`callbackUrl` is the url that will receive an update when the rendering process
has finished. The immediate response to the request will contain a `jobId` that
lets the client distinguish between status updates from different rendering
jobs.

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "jobId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
}
```

### Downloading rendered videos

Once the render job is finished or has failed, the revideo servide will send an
update to the specified callback url via a POST request. The response will
contain a download link from which you can download the exported video.

**Example Callback Response (success):**

```bash
curl -X POST <callbackUrl> \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "jobId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "status": "success",
  "downloadLink": "http://your-revideo-service.com/download/42078492-fbb9-4570-a329-785e87456618.mp4"
}'
```

You can now download the file using the download link:

```
GET http://your-revideo-service.com/download/42078492-fbb9-4570-a329-785e87456618.mp4
```

**Note:** You should not use this link as a method of permanently serving files
(for example to provide a download link to your users). Instead, it should only
be used to download the file once, and afterwards the file should be stored on a
permanent storage solution like a bucket. By default, the file will be deleted
10 minutes after the success callback.

**Example Callback Response (error):**

```bash
curl -X POST <callbackUrl> \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "jobId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "status": "error",
  "error": "<error message>"
}'
```
